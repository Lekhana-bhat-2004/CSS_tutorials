# CSS_tutorial_apnaclg

This repository contains my daily practice work while learning HTML and CSS, mainly following the Apna College Web Development Course.

## 📅 Purpose
I’m uploading one HTML and one CSS file each day to:
- Track my progress
- Show consistent contributions on GitHub
- Build a strong foundation in front-end development

## 📁 Folder Contents
Each file represents a different concept I’ve practiced from level 1 to level 5 of CSS, such as:
- Borders, padding, margin
- Text properties, alignment and decorations
- Box model, colors, and layouts

## 🚀 Learning Journey
This is not a finished website, but a record of what I’m learning step by step.
I’ll keep improving and building better projects as I go.
